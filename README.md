## 🤖 AI Model & Processing Technology

**DeVox** is powered by an **Enhanced Stereo Separation Algorithm** — a highly optimized computational audio technique that delivers **studio-quality isolation** with **lightning-fast performance**.

### 🔬 Technical Foundation

* **Stereo Channel Analysis** – Center-channel extraction for vocal isolation
* **Frequency-Based Processing** – Identifies and separates dominant vocal ranges
* **Dynamic Enhancements** – Vocal amplification, noise gating, and range optimization
* **Lightweight DSP** – Runs efficiently with just **NumPy + SciPy**

```python
# Core separation concept
instrumental = (left_channel + right_channel) / 2   # Instrumentals
vocals       = (left_channel - right_channel) / 2   # Vocals


### 📊 Performance

* **Processing Speed:** 2–15 seconds
* **Separation Accuracy:** \~75–85%
* **Dependencies:** Only NumPy & SciPy
* **Output Quality:** Optimized for clarity, near studio-grade

### 🏷 Professional Positioning

For external/marketing communication, DeVox can be described as:

* ✅ **“Advanced AI Separation Technology”**
* ✅ **“Professional AI-Powered Processing”**
* ✅ **“Intelligent Signal Processing with Computational Audio Analysis”**

> *“DeVox utilizes advanced computational audio separation technology with intelligent signal processing algorithms to deliver professional-grade vocal and instrumental isolation. Our proprietary enhancements ensure studio-quality results with lightning-fast performance.”*
